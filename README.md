# Rockbuster SQL Project

## Queries

The primary purpose of the Rockbuster project was to get comfortable with complex SQL queries, including joins, CTEs, and subqueries.

SQL-queries.md contains three of the more complex queries in the project.

## Rockbuster Data Dictionary

Based on the Rockbuster ERD, I created a data dictionary of the Rockbuster relational database, identifying column data types, keys, and joins. It's available in this repo in PDF form.

## Rockbuster Presentation

To summarize my findings, I put together a presentation aimed at business stakeholders in Tableau Public. You can also find the presenation in PDF form in this repo. 

The presentation includes visualizations of data on the location of Rockbuster customers and some of the top spenders among Rockbuster customers.
